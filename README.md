# CPU_SIMULATION

# **Multithreaded CPU-RAM Resource Allocation & Process Scheduling Simulation**

## Overview

This project is a **C++-based simulation** of a **multithreaded CPU process scheduling system** with **RAM management** and **resource allocation using semaphores**. It replicates real-world **operating system behavior**, handling process execution, priority-based scheduling, and resource contention, while ensuring **deadlock prevention**.

The implementation uses **multi-threading (`std::thread`)**, **priority queues**, **semaphores (`std::mutex`)**, and **synchronization techniques**, making it ideal for research in **OS scheduling, real-time computing, and process synchronization**.

## Features

 **Multithreaded Execution:** Simulates multiple CPU cores executing tasks in parallel.  
 **Priority-Based Scheduling:** Executes processes based on assigned priority.  
 **Quantum-Based CPU Scheduling:** Implements **Round Robin** scheduling.  
 **Shared Resource Management:** Uses **semaphores** to allocate shared resources.  
 **Deadlock Prevention:** Implements a controlled **wait-and-signal mechanism**.  
 **Dynamic Process Handling:** Supports runtime process addition.  
 **Realistic RAM Utilization:** Ensures efficient memory management.

## System Architecture

This project consists of **three main components**:

### ** RAM Management (`ram.h`) **

- Stores processes in a **priority queue**.
- Retrieves and removes processes dynamically as they are executed.

### ** CPU Execution (`cpu.h`) **

- Uses **multithreading** to simulate **multiple CPU cores**.
- Implements **Round-Robin scheduling** with **quantum execution**.

### ** Resource Manager (`resource_manager.h`) **

- Uses **semaphores (`std::mutex`)** to prevent deadlocks.
- Controls resource allocation and ensures safe access.

## Technical Details & Implementation

### ** Process Structure**

Each process has:

- **Process ID (`pid`)** – Unique identifier.
- **Priority (`priority`)** – Higher values indicate higher importance.
- **Steps (`steps`)** – Number of execution cycles.

### ** RAM Management**

- Uses a **min-heap priority queue** for efficient scheduling.
- Ensures **fair execution order** for processes.

### ** CPU Execution**

- Implements **Round-Robin scheduling**.
- Uses **multithreading (`std::thread`)** for parallel execution.

### ** Resource Allocation**

- Uses **semaphores (`std::mutex`)** to manage shared resources.
- Ensures **deadlock prevention** using **safe resource allocation**.

##  Process Execution Flow

1. **Processes are stored in RAM** with priority-based scheduling.
2. **CPU cores fetch processes** and execute for `q` quantum time.
3. **Processes request shared resources** using a semaphore lock.
4. **Completed processes release resources**, allowing other processes to execute.
5. **Threads execute concurrently**, ensuring efficient execution.

##  Research & Applications

This simulation provides **realistic OS behavior** and is valuable for:  
✔ **Operating System Research** – Study of scheduling algorithms.  
✔ **Real-Time Systems** – Simulations of deadline-based execution.  
✔ **Embedded Systems** – Execution under resource constraints.  
✔ **Parallel Computing** – Performance testing of multi-threaded execution.

##  Possible Enhancements

 **Priority Aging:** Prevents starvation by dynamically increasing process priority.  
 **Dynamic Process Addition:** Allows adding processes at runtime.  
 **I/O Bound & CPU Bound Tasks:** Simulates different execution behaviors.  
 **Machine Learning-Based Scheduling:** Optimizes execution dynamically.  
 **Cloud-Based Resource Allocation:** Simulates distributed computing environments.
